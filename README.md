# Beatsy
Drum computer using the Audio library
The project uses piezos as force sensitive triggers

Inputs:
 - 8 Piezo triggers connected to Teensy
 - Adafruit trellis for selecting banks/tracks.
 - possibly audio input for mp3 players

What works?
 - 4 Piezo triggers
 - Playing samples polyphonically with velocity
 - Multiplexer for analog inputs
 - playing sequences (copy code form pre-Beatsy)
 - adjusting variables with potentiometers

What to do?
 - recording/editing sequences
 - Selecting sequences with trellis
 - Selecting samples
 - Some sort of GUI. Either a ILI9341 or an I2C display
 - Sound input
 - make a nice case
